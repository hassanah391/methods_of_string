In this project I'm trying to explain some methods of String class :

1. Why do we use each one of them?
2. what're thier parameters?
3. What is the usage of each one of them?
4. What is the return value for each one?

# **Some of the methods that I'm trying to cover here :** contains(), codeUnitAt(), endsWith(), indexOf(), lastIndexOf(),...etc.
